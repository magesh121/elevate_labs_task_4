Performance Breakdown:

True Negatives (TN): 40 - Correctly identified malignant cases
False Positives (FP): 3 - Incorrectly predicted as benign
False Negatives (FN): 1 - Missed malignant case (critical error)
True Positives (TP): 70 - Correctly identified benign cases

🔍 Key Insights & Analysis
1. Data Characteristics

Dataset Balance: 37.3% Malignant, 62.7% Benign (moderately imbalanced)
Feature Types: 30 numerical features across mean, worst, and standard error measurements
Strong Predictors: Size-related features (radius, perimeter, area) and texture features show high discriminative power

2. Model Performance

Excellent Classification: 96.5% accuracy with high precision and recall
Low False Negative Rate: Only 1 missed malignant case (critical for medical diagnosis)
Strong Generalization: ROC-AUC of 0.992 indicates excellent discriminative ability

3. Feature Importance Insights
Top 5 Most Influential Features:

Worst Concave Points - Strongest predictor of malignancy
Worst Perimeter - Tumor boundary characteristics
Mean Concave Points - Cell shape irregularities
Worst Radius - Tumor size indicator
Mean Concavity - Surface texture features

Feature Categories Analysis:

Worst Features: Highest predictive power (extreme values)
Mean Features: Consistent baseline indicators
Standard Error Features: Lower but still significant contribution

4. Sigmoid Function Analysis

Successfully maps linear combinations to probabilities [0,1]
Smooth decision boundary at default threshold (0.5)
Clear separation between malignant and benign probability distributions

5. Threshold Optimization

Default Threshold (0.5): Optimal for balanced performance
Precision-Recall Trade-off: Well-balanced with minimal false negatives
Clinical Consideration: Low false negative rate prioritized for safety
